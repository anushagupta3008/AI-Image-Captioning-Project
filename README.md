# AI-Image-Captioning

The goal of image captioning is to automatically generate descriptions for a given image, i.e., to capture the relationship between the objects present in the image, generate natural language expressions and judge the quality of the generated descriptions.

DataSet Used - Flickr8k - https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k \
Used Resnet50 Transfer Learning for getting Image Features\
Used Google word2vec pretrained Model to get embeddings\
Used LSTM for predicting Captions using the encoded Image and word2vec model.
